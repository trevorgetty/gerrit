WANdisco (as defined below) offers a suite of software and maintenance and support services to its customers.  In addition,
WANdisco performs Professional Services (as defined below).  In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and conditions herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.    DEFINITIONS.
    1.1.    "Affiliates" means in relation to either party, each and any subsidiary or holding company of that party and each and any
    subsidiary of a holding company of that party.

    1.2.    "Confidential Information" means:  (a) the Software; and (b) any business or technical information of WANdisco or
    Customer, including but not limited to any information relating to WANdisco's or Customer's product plans, designs, costs,
    product prices and names, finances, marketing plans, business opportunities, personnel, research, development or know-how
    that is designated by the disclosing party as "confidential" or "proprietary" and, if orally disclosed, reduced to writing by the
    disclosing party within thirty (30) days of such disclosure.

    1.3.    "Intellectual Property Rights" means patent rights (including patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trademark
    rights, trade secret rights, know-how and any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the
    world.

    1.4.    "Professional Services" means additional services over and above maintenance and support such as installation,
    training, implementation and customization and provided on a project by project basis.

    1.5.    "Quotation" or "Quote" means the quote generated by WANdisco in response to Customer's indication of interest in the
    Software and associated maintenance and support services and/or Professional Services.  Quotes may also include the
    checkout page of an e-commerce website on which the Software is acquired.  The Quotation will contain particulars with
    respect to the Software, service, term, price and other details.  All Quotations are subject to and governed by the terms and
    conditions of this Agreement unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the parties.

    1.6.    "Software" means WANdisco's proprietary software products in object code form only, and related documentation,
    identified in the applicable Quotation and licensed for use by Customer pursuant to this Agreement, including any error
    corrections and updates thereto provided by WANdisco to Customer under this Agreement.  Software does not include OSS
    (as defined below).

    1.7.    "WANdisco" means the WANdisco entity named in the applicable Quotation.

2.    LICENSE.
    2.1.    Subscription Licenses.  For Quotes in which Customer has ordered a subscription license, and subject to the terms
    and conditions of this Agreement and in consideration of the fees paid by Customer hereunder, WANdisco grants to Customer
    a nonexclusive, nontransferable license, during the applicable term, to use the Software solely in accordance with the
    applicable documentation and solely for Customer's internal business use, except as otherwise may be expressly permitted in
    this Agreement. WANdisco reserves all rights and licenses in and to the Software not expressly granted herein.

    2.2.    Perpetual.  For Quotes in which Customer has ordered a perpetual license, and subject to the terms and conditions of
    this Agreement and in consideration of the fees paid by Customer hereunder, WANdisco grants to Customer a non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, perpetual (except as set forth in Section 11) license to use the Software solely in accordance with the
    applicable documentation and solely for Customer's internal business use, except as otherwise may be expressly permitted in
    this Agreement. WANdisco reserves all rights and licenses in and to the Software not expressly granted herein.

    2.3.    Usage Limitations.  Customer's use of the Software may be subject to usage limitations and other restrictions as
    described in the applicable Quotation (e.g., number of Fusion zones, data nodes, volume of replicated data, number of data
    storage types, number of users etc.)  Exceeding such usage limitations or restrictions may result in additional charges for
    which WANdisco will invoice Customer in accordance with Section 6 of this Agreement.  Failure to pay such additional charges
    may result in termination of Customer's license.  For purposes of this Agreement, (a) a "Fusion zone" is an instance of a
    logical storage system for which Fusion provides replication functionality. Such systems are responsible for storing the data
    that are replicated. Each Fusion Zone is serviced by one or more Fusion servers, and can participate in replication with other
    Fusion Zones. For example, a Fusion Zone could be a Hadoop cluster, an object storage bucket or endpoint, and or a locally-
    mounted file system; (b) "data nodes" means servers on which the Software is installed and on which data is made available
    for replication; (c) "replicated data" means the amount of data Customer makes available for replication by the Software, the
    amount of data Customer actually replicates, or the amount of data which has been checked for consistency, whichever is
    larger, regardless of the number of replicated copies, all consistent with WANdisco's Fair Use Policy.  "Fair Use Policy" means
    that once data has been replicated it is assumed such data maintains value for the remainder of the license term and hence
    continues to count against any data under replication quota.  For example, if Customer purchases a 3PB license with a one
    year term, and on day one of such term replicates 1PB then 2PB of quota remains accessible to Customer under the license.
    Customer may not take any action, or use any hardware, software or other method, designed to circumvent, or which has the
    effect of circumventing, any usage limitations?

    2.4.    Trial License.  Customer may be issued or provided access to a trial version of the Software.  Such trial version will be
    time limited and will provide Customer the opportunity to evaluate the Software prior to purchasing a license.  Upon conclusion
    of the applicable trial period, Customer shall either purchase a subscription or perpetual license, in which case a new license
    key will be issued, or Customer must immediately remove and cease using the Software.  DATA USED DURING A TRIAL OR
    DEMONSTRATION OF THE SOFTWARE MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO DATA CENTERS LOCATED IN THE UNITED
    STATES OR ELSEWHERE OUTSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.  CUSTOMER WILL NOT TRANSFER ANY
    PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR OTHER INFORMATION OR DATA THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE GDPR
    OR ANY OTHER LAW OR REGULATION.  CUSTOMER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL DATA USED DURING ANY
    SUCH TRIAL OR DEMONSTRATION AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW.

    2.5.    Quick Start or Restricted License.  Customer may purchase a "quick start" or other form of reduced usage or restricted
    license to the Software.  The applicable Quotation will describe the permitted usage and any other limitations for Customer's
    use of the Software.  Exceeding such usage or other restrictions may result in a requirement that Customer purchase the
    applicable non-restricted or "enterprise" license and terminate the restricted license, all of which will be described in a new
    Quotation.

    2.6.    License Keys.  Software usage is enabled via license keys provided by WANdisco upon payment of applicable license
    fees.  License keys are associated with applicable usage restrictions as described in Section 2.3, and once a license key has
    been issued, the applicable usage cannot be decreased during the applicable term of the key.  Increases to usage via
    separate Quotations will result in a new license key being issued.  If the Software is deployed in multiple replication groups or
    clusters, etc. a separate license key will be issued for each such replication group or clusters, following which usage in one
    replication group or cluster cannot be transferred to another replication group or cluster during the applicable term of the
    license key.  WANdisco may use license keys to enforce time and usage limitations of the Software and Customer shall take
    no action designed to alter or circumvent such enforcement.

    2.7.    License Restrictions.  Customer has no right to transfer, sublicense or otherwise distribute the Software to any third
    party.  Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement and by applicable law, the license granted above does not permit
    Customer to, and Customer may not permit third parties to:  (a) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the object
    code of the Software; (b) copy the Software, except for a reasonable number of backup copies; or (c) use the Software in any
    manner to provide service bureau, time-sharing or other computer services to third parties.  Use of the Software by or for the
    benefit of an Affiliate of Customer is not permitted unless specifically authorized in writing by WANdisco.

    2.8.    Maintenance and Support Services.  Subject to payment of the applicable fees, WANdisco will perform the
    maintenance and support services specified in a Quotation in accordance with WANdisco's standard Software maintenance
    and support procedures as described in Appendix A, incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which WANdisco
    publishes from time to time.

    2.9.    End of Life Policy.  WANdisco reserves the right to "end-of-life" certain software applications including the Software.  In
    such event, an end of life ("EOL") notice will be provided at least six (6) months prior to the date on which the Software will
    become obsolete.  During the EOL notice period, WANdisco will work with Customer to determine an appropriate migration
    path.  Customer shall be entitled to continue using EOL Software following the end of the EOL notice period but WANdisco will
    no longer provide any maintenance and support services for such EOL Software.

3.    PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
    3.1.    Services Provided.  Details concerning Professional Services to be performed by WANdisco (or by its Affiliates or its or
    their authorized subcontractors and certified channel partners) will be described in separate statements of work ("SOW")
    describing the project and related terms, if any, specific to the applicable Customer project.  All requests for Professional
    Services shall be accompanied by a completed SOW, a copy of which shall be attached to this Agreement at the appropriate
    time and deemed incorporated by reference herein.  No SOW shall be effective unless and until accepted in writing by
    WANdisco.  Any changes, amendments, or waivers ("Changes") to any SOW, or the Professional Services provided
    thereunder, requested by either party must be mutually agreed upon in writing and signed (each a "Change Order").
    WANdisco shall not be required to provide any Change unless and until a Change Order has been signed by an authorized
    representative of both parties, and any delay or additional charges resulting from any delay of Customer to execute a Change
    Order shall be the sole responsibility of Customer.  Changes to SOWs may result in adjustments to the charges and delays or
    changes in scheduled Professional Services.  Unless specifically agreed in an applicable SOW, Professional Services will be
    performed only during WANdisco's normal business hours, excluding weekends and holidays.  Requests by Customer to have
    Professional Services provided outside of normal business hours are Changes and must first be agreed to by WANdisco in a
    Change Order.

    3.2.    Term and Termination of Statements of Work.  Each SOW shall commence upon its execution by both parties and
    shall continue until all tasks described therein are completed, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section 3.2.  A SOW
    may be terminated by either party if any material breach of such SOW continues uncorrected for more than 30 days (10 days
    in the event of non-payment) after receipt of written notice from the aggrieved party describing the breach.  In the event of
    termination or expiration of this Agreement, all outstanding SOWs shall immediately terminate, unless otherwise agreed in
    writing by the parties.

    3.3.    Work Product.  Unless otherwise specifically agreed in an applicable SOW, WANdisco shall own all right, title and
    interest (including all Intellectual Property Rights) in and to all inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship,
    designs, know-how, ideas and information made or conceived or reduced to practice, in whole or in part, by or on behalf of
    WANdisco in connection with the Professional Services ("Work Product").  All Work Product created hereunder shall be
    licensed to Customer upon the same terms and conditions, and subject to the same restrictions, as the Software is licensed to
    Customer hereunder.

4.    CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS.
    4.1.    Certification.  At WANdisco's written request and not more frequently than annually, Customer shall furnish WANdisco
    with a signed certification verifying that the Software is being used in compliance with the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, including without limitation any applicable usage limitations.  WANdisco shall have the right to periodically audit
    Customer's usage of the Software, either physically or via remote access, and Customer shall provide reasonable assistance
    during any such audit.

    4.2.    Cooperation and Data.  Customer acknowledges that in order to properly perform its obligations under this Agreement
    and any executed statements of work, WANdisco may require access to Customer's premises, property, equipment, network,
    and other information, data and/or documentation ("Data") that WANdisco reasonably requests from Customer.  If Customer
    fails in the timely provision of Data, or fails to provide other access or cooperation, and such failures require additions,
    corrections or modifications related to WANdisco's performance, Customer will reimburse WANdisco for resulting costs.

    4.3.    Virus Prevention and Security.  WANdisco does not protect against, nor accept any liability for, third party intrusion into
    or damage to Customer's network or data center.  Customer must take all necessary steps to prevent against viruses,
    malicious code, hacking and other forms of network intrusion consistent with industry standards.  Customer represents and
    warrants that it understands and complies with all applicable laws and regulations related to or governing collection, storage,
    use and transmission of data.

5.    OWNERSHIP.  WANdisco or its Affiliates and their licensors presently own and will continue to own all worldwide right,
    title, and interest in and to the Software, including without limitation all modifications, revisions and derivative works thereto, by
    whomever made, and all worldwide Intellectual Property Rights therein.  Customer will not delete nor in any manner alter the
    copyright, trademark, and other proprietary rights notices of WANdisco or its Affiliates and their licensors appearing on the
    Software as delivered to Customer.  Customer will reproduce such notices on all copies it makes of the Software.

6.    PAYMENT.
    6.1.    Perpetual and Fixed Terms Licenses.
        (a)    License Fees.  Customer will pay to WANdisco the license fees set forth in the Quotation in accordance with the payment
        schedule set forth therein.  If the Quotation does not include a payment schedule, then payment of license fees are due in total
        in advance of commencement of the license.  If Customer requires a purchase order prior to payment of WANdisco's invoice, it
        shall be Customer's responsibility to generate and issue any such purchase order in enough time to prevent delay and/or
        termination of this Agreement and the applicable licenses.
        (b)    Maintenance and Support Fees.  Customer will pay to WANdisco the maintenance and support fees set forth in the
        Quotation in accordance with the payment schedule set forth therein.  If the Quotation does not include a payment schedule,
        then payment of maintenance and support fees are due annually in advance.  WANdisco shall have the right to revise the
        maintenance and support fees.  In such event, WANdisco shall notify Customer if, and by what amount, it intends to change
        the Maintenance and Support Fees, and Customer shall have the right, following such notice, to either continue to receive
        maintenance and support services under this Agreement and pay the revised fees or notify WANdisco, in writing no later than
        thirty (30) days following the date of WANdisco's notice, of Customer's intention to terminate its maintenance and support
        services at the end of the current period.  No change in maintenance and support fees shall affect Customer's current
        maintenance and support services for which Customer has already paid.
        (c)    OSS Support Services Fees. Customer will pay to WANdisco the OSS support fees set forth in the Quotation in
        accordance with the payment schedule set forth therein.  If the Quotation does not include a payment schedule, then payment
        of OSS support fees are due annually in advance.

    6.2.    Subscription Licenses.
        (a)    Subscription Fees.  Customer will pay to WANdisco the subscription fees set forth in the Quotation in accordance with
        the payment schedule set forth therein.  If the Quotation does not include a payment schedule, then payment of subscription
        fees is due annually, in advance without invoice, with payment of the first year's subscription fees due immediately following
        WANdisco's provision of the applicable license key to Customer.  If Customer requires a purchase order prior to payment of
        WANdisco's invoice, it shall be Customer's responsibility to generate and issue any such purchase order in enough time to
        prevent termination of this Agreement and the applicable licenses.  WANdisco shall have the right to revise the subscription
        fees at the end of Customer's applicable term.  In such event, WANdisco shall notify Customer if, and by what amount, it
        intends to change the subscription fees, and Customer shall have the right, following such notice, to either continue its
        Subscription under this Agreement and pay the revised subscription fees or notify WANdisco, in writing no later than thirty (30)
        days following the date of WANdisco's notice, of Customer's intention to terminate its subscription at the end of the current
        period.  No change in subscription fees shall affect Customer's current subscription for which Customer has already paid
        subscription fees.
        (b)    Maintenance and Support Fees. Maintenance and support services fees indicated on the applicable Quotation will be
        billed on an annual basis, payable in advance, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Quotation. In the event Customer fails
        to pay WANdisco on the due date, then to reinstate or renew maintenance and support services (if allowed by WANdisco),
        Customer must first pay WANdisco (i) the annual maintenance and support services fee, and (ii) the applicable reinstatement
        charge.
        (c)    OSS Support Services Fees. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Quotation, OSS support services fees are
        included in the subscription fees paid by Customer.

    6.3.    Multi-Year Licenses.  Customer acknowledges that multi-year licenses have been negotiated on the basis of
    preferential pricing for a multiple year commitment.  If a multi-year license is terminated early for any reason other than
    WANdisco's uncured breach, all unpaid license fees for the remaining years of the license term shall immediately become due
    and payable.

    6.4.    Professional Services.  Unless otherwise specified in an applicable statement of work, Professional Services shall be
    provided on a time and materials basis at the rates specified in the applicable SOW.  Customer will pay to WANdisco all
    amounts owed under an SOW no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice.

    6.5.    Travel and Incidental Expenses.  Customer will reimburse WANdisco for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
    incurred by WANdisco in connection with performing services at locations other than WANdisco's facility and, if Professional
    Services are provided under an SOW such expenses shall be reimbursed in accordance with the SOW.  Payment shall be
    made no later than thirty (30) days from the date of WANdisco's applicable invoice.

    6.6.    Payment Terms and Taxes.  Customer will pay all amounts due under this Agreement in the currency stated in the
    applicable Quotation and no later than thirty (30) days from the date of WANdisco's applicable invoice therefor.  All past due
    amounts will incur interest at a rate equal to the lower of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by law, beginning as of
    ten (10) days after the applicable due date.  Customer will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all applicable taxes of any
    kind (including but not limited to sales and use taxes) associated with this Agreement or Customer's receipt or use of the
    Software or the performance of services hereunder, except for example, taxes based on WANdisco's net income.  Termination
    or expiration of this Agreement, or any statement of work, shall not relieve Customer of any payment obligation incurred prior
    to such termination or expiration.

7.    WARRANTY.
    7.1.    Limited Software Warranty.  WANdisco warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days after the date the applicable
    license keys are provided the Software will function substantially in accordance with WANdisco's published documentation.
    Customer must notify WANdisco of any breach of the foregoing warranty no later than thirty (30) days following completion of
    the 90-day warranty period.  As Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and WANdisco's entire liability for any breach of the
    foregoing warranty, WANdisco will, at its sole option and expense, promptly repair or replace any Software that fails to meet
    this limited warranty.

    7.2.    Services Warranty.  WANdisco warrants that services provided by WANdisco hereunder will be performed in a good
    and workmanlike manner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  In the event of a breach by WANdisco of the
    foregoing warranty of which Customer notifies WANdisco in writing no later than thirty (30) days from completion of the
    applicable service, WANdisco will correct at WANdisco's expense, any non-conforming portion of such service.

    7.3.    Third Party Products.  The Software is designed to work with third party storage solutions.  WANdisco makes no
    warranty, express or implied, with respect to such third party products and is not responsible for failure of the overall solution
    to operate properly if such failures are a result of third party products.  WANdisco may be required to interact with such third
    parties in order to diagnose and resolve problems, and Customer agrees to coordinate communication and cooperation
    between WANdisco and such third parties.

    7.4.    Disclaimer of Warranties.  THE LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7 ARE IN LIEU OF, AND
    WANDISCO HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO THOSE OF ACCURACY, MERCHANTABILITY/SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  WANDISCO DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR WORK
    PRODUCT WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE SOFTWARE, WORK PRODUCT OR ANY
    SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S NEEDS.  FURTHER, WANDISCO MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
    AND ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY FOR ANY FAILURE OR FAULT, OR ANY RESULTING HARM OR DAMAGE, RESULTING
    FROM CUSTOMER'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT OR OPERATE THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WITHOUT
    LIMITATION FAILURE OF CUSTOMER'S HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR NETWORK ON WHICH THE SOFTWARE
    OPERATES OR FAULTS OR FAILURES OF THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE NOR RESULTING FROM CUSTOMER'S FAILURE
    TO IMPLEMENT ADVICE PROVIDED BY WANDISCO AS PART OF ITS SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES.

8.    INDEMNIFICATION.
    8.1.    Infringement Indemnity.  WANdisco will defend any action brought against Customer by an unaffiliated third party that
    the Software, as provided by WANdisco to Customer under this Agreement and used within the scope of this Agreement,
    infringes any U.S. patent or copyright, and will pay any costs, damages and reasonable attorneys' fees attributable to such
    claim that are awarded against Customer, provided that Customer:  (a) promptly notifies WANdisco in writing of the claim;
    (b) grants WANdisco sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim; and (c) provides WANdisco with all assistance,
    information and authority required for the defense and settlement of the claim.

    8.2.    Injunctions.  If Customer's use of any of the Software hereunder is, or in WANdisco's opinion is likely to be, enjoined or
    restricted due to the type of infringement specified in Section 8.1 above, WANdisco may, at its sole option and expense:
    (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Software under the terms of this Agreement; (b) replace or modify
    such Software so that it is non-infringing and substantially equivalent in function to the enjoined or restricted Software; or (c) if
    options (a) and (b) above are not commercially feasible despite WANdisco's reasonable efforts, then WANdisco may terminate
    Customer's rights and WANdisco's obligations hereunder with respect to such Software and refund to Customer (1) for
    perpetual licenses, a pro-rata portion of the License Fee paid for such Software based on a three-year straight line
    depreciation schedule, or (2) for subscription licenses, the amount of any prepaid but unused Subscription Fees.

    8.3.    Exclusions.  Notwithstanding the terms of Section 8.1, WANdisco will have no liability for, and Customer will indemnify
    WANdisco for, any claim to the extent it results from: (a) modification of the Software made other than by WANdisco; (b) the
    combination, operation or use of any Software supplied hereunder with equipment, devices or software not supplied by
    WANdisco to the extent such a claim would have been avoided if the Software were not used in such combination; (c) failure
    of Customer to use updated or modified Software provided by WANdisco to avoid infringement; or (d) compliance by
    WANdisco with designs, plans or specifications furnished by or on behalf of Customer.

    8.4.    Sole Remedy.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 8 SET FORTH WANDISCO'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS, AND
    CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND.

9.    CONFIDENTIALITY.
    9.1.    Use and Disclosure Restrictions.  During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of five (5) years after any
    termination of this Agreement, each party will use the other party's Confidential Information only as permitted herein, and will
    not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party except to employees and consultants as is reasonably required in
    connection with the exercise of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (and only subject to binding use and disclosure
    restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein executed in writing by such employees and consultants).  However,
    each party may disclose Confidential Information of the other party:  (a) pursuant to the order or requirement of a court,
    administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the disclosing party gives reasonable notice to the other
    party to contest such order or requirement; and (b) on a confidential basis to legal or financial advisors.

    9.2.    Exclusions.  The use and disclosure restrictions set forth in Section 9.1 shall not apply to information that:  (a) is or

    receiving party at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by the receiving
    party without use of the disclosing party's Confidential Information; (d) the receiving party rightfully obtains from a third party
    without restriction on use or disclosure; or (e) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the disclosing party.

10.    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
    10.1.    Total liability.  EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN APPENDIX B, EACH PARTY'S, AND ITS LICENSORS', CUMULATIVE
    LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, WILL BE LIMITED

        RISE TO THE CLAIM FOR THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR
        CLAIM.

    10.2.    EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. NEITHER PARTY SHALL IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
    LOSSES OR DAMAGES WHICH MAY BE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER (OR ANY PERSON CLAIMING UNDER OR

    TIME; LOSS OF GOODWILL; COST OF PROCUREMENT OF ALTERNATIVE SOFTWARE; AND WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY
    ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT

    LOSS OR DAMAGE.

    10.3.    Exclusions.  The limitations of liability and exclusion of damages set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 above shall not

    10.4.    High Risk Activities.  The Software and work product are not fault-tolerant and are not designed, manufactured or
    intended for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, including without limitation the operation of
    nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons
    systems, in which the failure of the Software or work product could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
    environmental damage.  WANdisco and its suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty or liability for such
    activities.

    10.5.    Basis of Bargain.  The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that WANdisco has set its prices and entered into this
    Agreement in reliance upon the limitations of liability specified herein, which allocate the risk between WANdisco and
    Customer.

11.    TERM AND TERMINATION.
    11.1.    Perpetual and Fixed Term Licenses.
        (a)    Term.  This Agreement will begin on the date Customer accepts this Agreement and will remain in effect thereafter
        unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  The term of each Software license granted by
        WANdisco hereunder will begin on the date of the Quotation applicable to the Software and will remain in effect thereafter until
        Customer discontinues use of such Software or until terminated earlier by either party in accordance with the terms of this
        Agreement.
        (b)    Maintenance and Support Services.  Maintenance and support services commence on the date set forth in the applicable
        Quotation and remain in effect for an initial term of one (1) year, or such other term as specified in the Quotation ("Initial
        Term"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Following the Initial Term, maintenance and
        support services automatically renew for additional one year terms, or such other renewal terms as specified in the Quotation
        (each a "Renewal Term") unless and until Customer notifies WANdisco, no later than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the
        then-current term, that it does not wish to renew the maintenance and support services.  If Customer cancels maintenance and
        support services and thereafter reinstates such services, a reinstatement fee will apply, which, unless otherwise agreed in
        writing, is the amount of maintenance and support fees Customer would have paid had it not canceled such services.

    11.2.    Subscription Licenses.
        (a)    Term.  This Agreement will begin on the date Customer accepts this Agreement and will remain in effect thereafter
        unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Subscription licenses begin on the date set forth in
        the applicable Quotation and remain in effect for an initial term of one (1) year, or such other term as specified in the Quotation
        ("Initial Term"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Following the Initial Term,
        subscription licenses automatically renew for additional one year terms at WANdisco's then-current annual license fee, or such
        other renewal terms as specified in the Quotation (each a "Renewal Term") unless and until either party notifies the other, no
        later than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term, that it does not wish to renew the subscription.  WANdisco
        may employ electronic means to terminate Customer's access to Software following termination of a trial version or upon
        conclusion of a subscription.
        (b)    Maintenance and Support Services.  Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Quotation, maintenance and support
        services are included in the subscription and commence and terminate on the same dates as the subscription except that
        WANdisco reserves the right to suspend and/or terminate maintenance and support services if Customer fails to implement
        advice received from WANdisco as part of the maintenance and support services.

    11.3.    Termination for Breach.  Each party will have the right to terminate this Agreement or any Software license granted
    hereunder if the other party breaches any material term of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days
    after written notice thereof.

    11.4.    Automatic Termination.  This Agreement, but not the Software licenses, will terminate automatically if Customer:
    (a) becomes the subject of any voluntary petition in bankruptcy or any voluntary proceeding relating to insolvency,
    receivership, liquidation, or composition for the benefit of creditors; or (b) becomes the subject of an involuntary petition in
    bankruptcy or any involuntary proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or composition for the benefit of
    creditors, if such petition or proceeding is not dismissed within sixty (60) days of filing.

    11.5.    Effect of Termination.  Upon any termination of this Agreement or of any individual Software license granted hereunder,
    Customer will: (i) promptly pay all outstanding amounts owing to WANdisco, including without limitation under any statement of
    work; and (ii) immediately cease all use of the applicable Software and will promptly return to WANdisco or, at WANdisco's
    request, destroy, all WANdisco Confidential Information then in Customer's possession, including without limitation the
    applicable Software, and all copies and portions thereof, in all forms and types of media, and provide WANdisco with an
    officer's written certification, certifying to Customer's compliance with the foregoing.

    11.6.    Nonexclusive Remedy.  Termination of this Agreement by either party will be a nonexclusive remedy for breach and will
    be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of such party.

    11.7.    Survival.  The rights and obligations of the parties contained in Sections 2.7, 3.3, 5, 6, 7.4, 9, 10, 11.7 and 12 will survive
    the termination of this Agreement or of any individual Software license.

12.    GENERAL.
    12.1.    Open Source.  Certain components of the Software may contain open source software.  Information regarding open
    source included in the Software can be found at www.wandisco.com/licensing. Subject to payment of the applicable fees,
    WANdisco will perform the maintenance and support services specified in a Quotation in accordance with WANdisco's
    standard OSS support procedures as described in Appendix B, incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which
    WANdisco publishes from time to time.  "OSS" means the most recent, stable release of the open source software (i.e.,
    Subversion, Git or other open source software supported by WANdisco), which must be obtained directly from WANdisco in
    order to be supported by WANdisco.  OSS is licensed by Customer and subject to the applicable license agreement between
    Customer and the author.

    12.2.    Assignment.  Customer will have no right to assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
    otherwise, without WANdisco's prior written consent.  Any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent will be null
    and void.

    12.3.    Governing Law and Jurisdiction.
        (a)    US and Canadian Customers.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of

        matter hereof shall be the state and U.S. federal courts located in the jurisdiction in which WANdisco, Inc.'s headquarters is
        located.  Both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and agree that process may be served in the manner provided
        herein for giving of notices or otherwise as allowed by California state or U.S. federal law.  In any action or proceeding to
        enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees.
        (b)    Customers in All Other Jurisdictions.  If Customer acquired the Software in any other country than the US or Canada, this
        Agreement and any claim under or in connection with it shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales.  The sole
        jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be London, England.  This Agreement describes
        certain legal rights.  Customer may have other rights under the laws of Customer's state or country. Customer may also have
        rights with respect to the party from which it acquired the software. This Agreement does not change those other rights if the
        laws of Customer's state or country do not permit it to do so.

    12.4.    Government End Users.  If Customer is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government
    ("Government"), the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software or any related

    12.5.    Export.  Customer acknowledges and agrees to comply fully with the laws and regulations of the United States that
    restrict the export and re-export of commodities and technical data of United States origin ("Export Laws") and will assure that
    neither the Software nor any direct product thereof are (1) exported or re-exported, directly or indirectly, by Customer or any of
    Customer's transferees without first obtaining the appropriate United States and foreign government licenses; and (2) intended
    to be used for any purposes prohibited by the Export Laws, including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological
    weapons proliferation.  Customer's obligations hereunder shall at all times be subject to the export control laws and
    regulations of the United States government and any amendments thereto.

    12.6.    M&A Activities.  In the event Customer is acquired by, or acquires, another entity, including another WANdisco
    customer, Customer divests a portion of its company, or Customer desires to otherwise transfer, combine or assign licenses,
    (i) any transfer or assignment must be pursuant to WANdisco's prior written consent, (ii) Customer shall pay WANdisco's
    standard license transfer fee, (iii) if the deployment of the licenses is kept separate, or if each entity has licenses with different
    expiration dates, then there shall be no shared licenses, and each deployment will retain separate license keys as described in
    Section 2.6 above, and (iv) licenses are only permitted to be shared or combined if new licenses with consolidated expiration
    dates, and new license keys, are issued pursuant to a new Quotation.

    12.7.    Privacy.
        (a)    Customer consents to the processing of personal information by WANdisco and its agents to facilitate the subject matter
        of this Agreement.  Customer will obtain all required consents from third parties (including Customer's contacts, administrators

        specified in WANdisco's Privacy Policy.  WANdisco will abide by the requirements of the European Economic Area and Swiss
        data protection law regarding the collection, use, transfer, retention, and other processing of personal data from the European
        Economic Area and Switzerland.

    12.8.    Severability.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or
    unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of
    this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

    12.9.    Waiver.  The failure by either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future
    enforcement of that or any other provision.

    12.10.    Notices.  All notices required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered by courier or overnight
    delivery service, or by certified mail, and in each instance will be deemed given upon receipt.  All communications will be sent
    to the other party's registered office address or to such other address as may be specified by either party to the other in
    accordance with this Section.  Either party may change its address for notices under this Agreement by giving written notice to
    the other party by the means specified in this Section.

    12.11.    Force Majeure.  If either party is unable to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or to enjoy any of its
    benefits because of (or if loss of services is caused by) natural disaster, action or decrees of governmental bodies, or
    communication line failure not the fault of the affected party ("Force Majeure Event"), the party who has been so affected shall
    immediately give notice to the other party and shall do everything possible to resume performance.  Upon receipt of such
    notice, all obligations under this Agreement will be immediately suspended.  If the period of nonperformance exceeds fifteen
    (15) days from the receipt of notice of the Force Majeure Event, the party whose performance has not been so affected may,
    by giving written notice, terminate this Agreement.  If a party fails to give immediate notice of any Force Majeure Event, and
    such failure to provide immediate notice causes the other party to incur costs or expenses that would have been avoided had
    such immediate notice been provided, then the party who failed to provide the requisite notice shall remain responsible for
    such costs or expenses.

    12.12.    Relationship of Parties.  The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors and this Agreement will not
    establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency between the parties.  Neither party
    will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other's behalf without the other's prior written consent.

    12.13.    Announcements.  Customer agrees that WANdisco may publicly announce and list Customer as a customer of
    WANdisco.

    12.14.    Non-Solicitation.  Customer acknowledges that WANdisco has expended substantial time and money in the selection
    and training of its employees.  Accordingly, Customer will not, directly or through an intermediary, solicit, utilize or employ any
    employees of WANdisco during or for a period of one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement.  In the event
    Customer employs an employee of WANdisco during the term of this Agreement or during the one year period after
    termination thereof, Customer shall pay, as liquidated damages to WANdisco, an amount equal to one (1) year's salary of such
    hired employee (at the payment rate at the time of the employee's termination of employment with WANdisco) plus any
    incentive bonuses paid by WANdisco to the subject employee in the twelve (12) months preceding the subject employee's
    termination of employment with WANdisco.

    12.15.    Drafting.  All parties and their counsel have had an opportunity to review and contribute to the drafting of this
    Agreement, and the rule of construction providing that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
    employed in the interpretation of this Agreement.  This Agreement shall be construed as drafted by both parties.

    12.16.    Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, including all schedules, exhibits and attachments attached hereto, contains the
    complete understanding and agreement of the parties and, other than the terms and special terms set forth in applicable
    Quotations, supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject
    matter herein.  Except for Quotations, statements of work and change request forms, no terms, provisions or conditions of any
    purchase order, acknowledgement or other business form that either party may use in connection with the transactions
    contemplated by this Agreement will have any effect on the rights, duties or obligations of the parties under, or otherwise
    modify, this Agreement, regardless of any failure of a receiving party to object to such terms, provisions or conditions.  Any
    waiver, modification or amendment of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by duly
    authorized representatives of the parties.


Appendix A

These Maintenance and Support terms relate to and are incorporated into the Agreement.  Capitalized terms not defined in
Section 7 below have the same meaning as in the Agreement.
1.    COVERAGE
Subject to the terms hereof, WANdisco will provide maintenance and support services only to Customer and only if the
applicable fees have been paid by Customer. Customer must order the same support level for each Software copy
licensed, and failure to renew maintenance and support services for some Software copies shall result in termination of
maintenance and support services for all Software copies acquired by Customer.  Full maintenance and support services
are provided only after Customer has fully implemented the Software.  Pre-implementation support may be available from
WANdisco under a separate statement of work.

2.    MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES
    a.    Maintenance and support services consist of (a) WANdisco's online trouble ticket reporting system, (b) Telephone
    Support for critical queries, (c) Error Correction and (d) product Updates. Maintenance and support services are
    provided to, and may be accessed only by, the Technical Support Contact to whom login credentials have been
    provided.  The number of Technical Support Contacts and login credentials depends on the Software licensed by
    Customer and the support service tier selected.  Login credentials are personal to the Technical Support Contact and
    may not be shared with any other Customer personnel or contractor.  Customer is responsible for all use of such
    login credentials, and additional credentials must be obtained from WANdisco if additional Technical Support
    Contacts are desired.  Product Updates consist of one copy of published revisions to the printed documentation and
    one copy of revisions to the machine readable Software that are not New Products.

    b.    WANdisco shall advise Customer of New Products that it decides, in its sole discretion, to make available to
    Customer by adding it to the Agreement.  Payment for New Products is not covered by the maintenance and support
    or subscription fee.  All product Updates or New Products provided to Customer shall be governed by the terms of the
    Agreement, including without limitation the applicable fees and discounts. Upon installation of Updates or New
    Products, prior versions or releases are to be destroyed.

    c.    WANdisco shall provide all Resolutions to the Technical Support Contact for implementation. WANdisco
    implementation of Resolutions is provided only as a professional service, for which additional fees will apply as
    outlined in an applicable statement of work that must be executed prior to WANdisco performing such services.

    d.    WANdisco will provide maintenance and support services for OSS in accordance with this Appendix A; provided,
    however, that WANdisco makes no warranty or guarantee that any Fix, Workaround or other Error Correction
    suggested or developed by WANdisco will be accepted by the open source community and/or be incorporated into
    future OSS versions.

3.    TIERED SERVICES.  Maintenance and support services are provided to Customer in accordance with the applicable tier
purchased by Customer.  The tiers are set forth below.  Silver Support is provided only for OSS. All Software copies will

4.    ERROR PRIORITY LEVELS AND RESPONSE TIMES
    a.    WANdisco shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to correct any Error reported by Customer in the current
    unmodified release of Software in accordance with the priority level reasonably assigned to such Error by WANdisco
    and in accordance with the support level purchased by Customer.

    b.    Upon receipt of an Error report, WANdisco will promptly evaluate the reported Error and classify it as Priority 1, 2, 3,
    or 4.  As an Error is addressed, the classification of such Error may change.  Following such classification, WANdisco
    will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the following, in accordance with the support levels set forth
    below:
    i.    Respond to Customer and assign WANdisco engineers to correct the Error;
    ii.    Provide Customer with status updates of the corrections; and
    iii.    Initiate work to provide Customer with a Resolution ("Response Time").

    +----------+----------------+--------------+------------------+
    | Priority | Silver Support | Gold Support | Platinum Support |
    +----------+----------------+--------------+------------------+
    |1         | 4 hours        | 2 hours      | 1 hour           |
    |2         | 24 hours       | 16 hours     | 4 hours          |
    |3         | 72 hours       | 48 hours     | 24 hours         |
    |4         | 10 Days        | 7 Days       | 5 Days           |
    +----------+----------------+--------------+------------------+

    Response Time means the amount of time between the initial report of an Error to WANdisco and when a
    WANdisco support engineer initiates a support session with Customer's Technical Support Contact to
    resolve the Error.  Once a support session has been initiated, WANdisco will work continuously with
    Customer's Technical Support Contact, during Customer's applicable support hours as determined by
    Customer's support tier, to resolve the Error and provide a Resolution.  Errors reported via telephone by Silver
    Support Customers will be logged into the online trouble ticket system and addressed in accordance with the
    Response Times set forth above.

    c.    In order for WANdisco to perform Error Corrections, Customer must provide information and access reasonably
    requested by WANdisco, including without limitation talkbacks, Apache logs, system logs and screen shares.
    WANdisco will provide support via remote access upon Customer's request.

    d.    If WANdisco believes that a problem reported by Customer may not be due to an Error in the Software, WANdisco
    will so notify Customer. At that time, Customer may (1) instruct WANdisco to proceed with problem determination at
    Customer's possible expense as set forth below, or (2) instruct WANdisco that Customer does not wish the problem
    pursued at Customer's possible expense. If Customer requests that WANdisco proceed with problem determination
    at Customer's possible expense and WANdisco determines that the problem was not due to an Error in the Software,
    Customer shall pay WANdisco, at WANdisco' then-current and standard consulting rates, for all work performed in
    connection with such determination, plus reasonable related expenses incurred therewith. Customer shall not be
    liable for (i) problem determination or repair to the extent problems are due to Errors in the Software, (ii) work
    performed under this paragraph in excess of its instructions or (iii) work performed after Customer has notified
    WANdisco that it no longer wishes work on the problem determination to be continued at Customer's possible
    expense (such notice shall be deemed given when actually received by WANdisco). If Customer instructs WANdisco
    that it does not wish the problem pursued at Customer's possible expense or if such determination requires effort in
    excess of Customer's instructions, WANdisco may, at its sole discretion, elect not to investigate the problem with no
    liability therefor.

5.    EXCLUSIONS
        a.    WANdisco shall have no obligation to support:
        i.    altered, damaged or modified Software or any portion of the Software incorporated with or into other software;
        ii.    Software that is not the then-current release or immediately Previous Sequential Release;
        iii.    Where Customer fails to provide information or access as required in Section 4.c above.

        including those defined as Force Majeure Events at Section 12.9 of the Agreement; or
        v.    Software installed on any computing environment that is not supported by WANdisco.
        b.    WANdisco shall have no liability for any changes in Customer's hardware that may be necessary to use the Software
        due to a New Product, Workaround or maintenance Update.

6.    ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
    As part of the maintenance and support services provided hereunder, WANdisco may create a root cause analysis report
    to be shared with Customer.  A root cause analysis report is for information purposes only and does not obligate

        approval from WANdisco support in a written agreement signed by Customer and WANdisco.  If Customer has
        not obtained such approval and is not using one of the operating systems listed, then WANdisco will not be
        obligated to provide Customer with support services as otherwise required under this Agreement.

        1.2.2.    Client Operating System.  WANdisco supports Customer's use of OSS with client operating systems specified
        on WANdisco's support website.   If Customer is using an operating system other than one of these listed
        systems, WANdisco will provide Customer with support services only if Customer has obtained prior approval
        from WANdisco support in a written agreement signed by Customer and WANdisco.   If Customer has not
        obtained such approval and is not using one of the operating systems listed, then WANdisco will not be
        obligated to provide Customer with support services as otherwise required under this Agreement.

        1.2.3.    Client Software.  WANdisco supports Customer's use of OSS with the clients specified on WANdisco's support
        website.  If Customer is using a client other than one of these listed clients, WANdisco will provide Customer
        with support services only if Customer has obtained prior approval from WANdisco Support in a written
        agreement signed by Customer and WANdisco.  If Customer has not obtained such approval and is not using
        one of the clients listed, then WANdisco will not be obligated to provide Customer with support services as
        otherwise required under this Agreement.

        1.2.4.    Additional Required Information.  Upon Customer's purchase of OSS support services, WANdisco will send an
        email requesting certain additional information about Customer's OSS environment and the names of those
        personnel within Customer's organization who will be authorized as a "Named Support Contact" under
        Appendix A to contact WANdisco.   This information is required in order to provide complete OSS support. If
        Customer does not provide this information to WANdisco, Customer understands and agrees that this failure
        may prevent WANdisco from providing timely support and maintenance services as otherwise might be
        required under the terms of this Agreement.

    1.3.    Changes to Level of Support.  Should Customer decide to increase or decrease the level of support, Customer has
    purchased, any such change must be made by executing and submitting to WANdisco Support its standard change
    request form; provided however that if the request is to decrease the level of support, such change can only be
    made on the annual renewal anniversary for Customer's then current support level and the change request form
    must be submitted at least thirty (30) days before such anniversary.  Customer must order the same support level for
    each copy of OSS licensed.

    1.4.    License.  Upgrades and other materials are licensed to Customer under the same terms and conditions as Customer
    licensed the OSS.

    1.5.    Indemnity.  If Customer has purchased the Platinum Support Level, Customer is entitled to the following
    indemnification, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

        1.5.1.    WANdisco will defend or settle, at its expense, any action brought or allegation made against Customer by a
        third party to the extent that it is based upon a claim that the OSS provided by WANdisco to Customer under
        this Agreement and used within the scope of this Agreement, infringes any copyright, trade secret, patent or
        trademark right of such third party, and will pay any costs, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
        fees), and liabilities attributable to such claims that are awarded against Customer.  WANdisco' obligations
        hereunder are contingent on the following conditions:

        1.5.1.1.    Customer must have obtained all OSS binaries, including upgrades, from WANdisco; and

        1.5.1.2.    Customer must notify WANdisco in writing promptly after Customer becomes aware of a claim or the
        possibility thereof; and

        1.5.1.3.    Customer must grant WANdisco the sole control of the settlement, compromise, negotiation, and
        defense of any such action; and

        1.5.1.4.    Customer must provide WANdisco with all information related to the action that is reasonably requested
        by WANdisco.

    1.5.2.    The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any infringement claim to the extent arising from (i) use of binaries
    from a source other than WANdisco, (ii) OSS that has been modified by anyone other than WANdisco, (iii)
    Customer's use of OSS in conjunction with Customer's data where use with such data gave rise to the
    infringement claim, (iv) Customer's use of OSS with other software or hardware, where use with such other
    software or hardware gave rise to the infringement claim, (v) use of other than the most current, unaltered
    version of OSS if such claim would have been avoided by the use of such version, (vi) compliance by
    WANdisco with designs, plans or specifications furnished by or on behalf of Customer, or (vii) Customer's use
    or distribution of OSS not in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable license agreement.

    1.5.3.    WANdisco shall not be liable hereunder for any settlement made by Customer without WANdisco's advance
    written approval or for any award from any action in which WANdisco was not granted control of the defense.

    1.5.4.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, WANdisco's liability under this
    Appendix B shall be limited to four (4) times the amount paid or payable by Customer under this Agreement for
    OSS Support Services.

    1.5.5.    This Appendix B states WANdisco' entire liability and Customer's (and Customer's agents' and customers')
    exclusive remedy for infringement of intellectual property rights of any kind by the OSS.

    2.    OSS IS AN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, OWNED AND LICENSED BY A THIRD PARTY.  WANDISCO
    MAKES OSS AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMER SOLELY AS A CONVENIENCE AND, SAVE AS SET OUT ABOVE,
    ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY OR OBLIGATION AS A RESULT THEREOF.  WANDISCO MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
    GUARANTEES REGARDING OSS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO OSS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
    WARRANTIES OR OTHER TERMS OF MERCHANTABILITY/SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DESIGN OR USE OR ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING,
    USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE.  WANDISCO DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT OSS OR ANY
    UPDATES OR UPGRADES PROVIDED BY WANDISCO WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.
